## What is a wordpress?
WordPress is the simplest, most popular way to create your own website or blog. In fact, WordPress powers over 43.3% of all the websites on the Internet. Yes – more than one in four websites that you visit are likely powered by WordPress.
## What Kinds Of Websites Can WordPress Make?
WordPress was primarily a tool to create a blog, rather than more traditional websites. That hasn’t been true for a long time, though. Nowadays, thanks to changes to the core code, as well as WordPress’ massive ecosystem of plugins and themes, you can create any type of website with WordPress.

For example, not only does WordPress power a huge number of business sites and blogs, it’s also the most popular way to create an eCommerce store as well! With WordPress, you can create:
<ul>
  <li>Business websites</li>
  <li>eCommerce stores</li>
  <li>Blogs</li>
  <li>Portfolios</li>
  <li>Resumes</li>
  <li>Forums</li>
  <li>Social networks</li>
  <li>Membership sites</li>
</ul>
